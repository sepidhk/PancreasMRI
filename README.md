# PancreasMRI

## Introduction
The project of PancreasMRI performs pancreas segmentation on abdominal MRI images from UT-Austin using 3D transformer-based model UNesT. The images are T1-weighted MRI from subjects with type I diabetes. Although CT images are widely studied by scientists, very limited research are conducted on the segmentation of abdminal MRI images, and this project is the world's first pancreas segmentation study on MRI images of patients with type I diabetes. In this project, we developed an automated framework to pre-process, train, validation, and test the dataset, and we achieved mean dice 0.724 using five-fold cross validation.
